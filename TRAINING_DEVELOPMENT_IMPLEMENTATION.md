## Feature 1: Fixed Closing Position Assignments

### Overview

Fixed closing position assignments allow managers to designate specific staff members to always be assigned to particular closing positions during night shifts. This feature overrides the automatic assignment logic and ensures experienced closers or shift leaders are consistently placed in critical closing roles.

### Business Requirements

- **Priority**: Fixed assignments must take **highest priority** over all auto-assignment logic
- **Flexibility**: Support assignments for specific days of week or all days
- **Multiple Assignments**: Staff can have multiple fixed positions with different priorities
- **Shift Types**: Support Night Shift, Day Shift, or Both
- **Audit Trail**: Track who assigned each fixed position and when

### Technical Implementation

#### Database Schema

**Table: `staff_fixed_closing_positions`**

```sql
CREATE TABLE staff_fixed_closing_positions (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  staff_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES staff(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  position_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES positions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  shift_type text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Night Shift',
  day_of_week text CHECK (day_of_week IN ('Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday', NULL)),
  priority integer DEFAULT 1,
  is_active boolean DEFAULT true,
  assigned_by uuid REFERENCES staff(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  assigned_date timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  notes text DEFAULT '',
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  UNIQUE(staff_id, position_id, shift_type, day_of_week)
);
```

#### Auto-Assignment Logic Integration

**File**: `src/utils/intelligentDeploymentAssignment.js`

**Function**: `findClosingPosition(staffId, date, shiftType)`

```javascript
async function findClosingPosition(staffId, date, shiftType) {
  // Step 1: Check for fixed closing assignments (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
  const dayOfWeek = new Date(date).toLocaleDateString('en-US', { weekday: 'long' });

  const { data: fixedClosing } = await supabase
    .from('staff_fixed_closing_positions')
    .select('position:position_id (id, name)')
    .eq('staff_id', staffId)
    .eq('is_active', true)
    .or(`shift_type.eq.${shiftType},shift_type.eq.Both`)
    .or(`day_of_week.eq.${dayOfWeek},day_of_week.is.null`)
    .order('priority', { ascending: true })
    .limit(1);

  if (fixedClosing && fixedClosing.length > 0) {
    return fixedClosing[0].position.name;
  }

  // Step 2: Fall back to training-based assignment
  const { data: closingTraining } = await supabase
    .from('staff_closing_training')
    .select('position:position_id (id, name)')
    .eq('staff_id', staffId)
    .eq('is_trained', true);

  // ... rest of logic
}
```

#### UI Component

**File**: `src/components/FixedClosingPositionsPage.jsx`

**Features**:
- Create new fixed assignments with staff member, position, shift type, day of week selection
- View all fixed assignments in organized list
- Toggle assignments active/inactive
- Delete assignments
- Priority management
- Notes and audit trail

**Access Path**: Training & Rules → Fixed Closing Positions

### Use Cases

1. **Experienced Closer Assignment**: Assign senior team members to always close Front Counter on Friday/Saturday nights
2. **Shift Leader Positioning**: Ensure shift leaders are always assigned to Kitchen Manager closing position
3. **Day-Specific Assignments**: Assign specific staff to specific positions on their regular working days
4. **Training Overrides**: Temporarily override auto-assignment for staff undergoing specialized training

## Security Considerations

### Data Access

- All tables have Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Public read/write access (consistent with existing architecture)
- Consider implementing role-based access in future iterations

### Sensitive Information

- Training notes may contain performance information
- Effectiveness metrics may contain sensitive assessments
- Consider adding field-level encryption for sensitive notes

### Audit Trail

- All tables track created_at and updated_at timestamps
- Assignment changes tracked with assigned_by field
- Completion verification tracked with verification_by field

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Fixed closing assignment not being applied

**Solution**:
1. Verify assignment is set to `is_active = true`
2. Check shift_type matches the deployment shift
3. Check day_of_week is either NULL or matches the deployment date
4. Verify priority is set correctly (lower = higher priority)

**Issue**: Training plan progress not updating

**Solution**:
1. Ensure training plan items are properly linked to the plan
2. Check item status is set to 'Completed'
3. Refresh the page to reload data

**Issue**: Mandatory training showing as overdue incorrectly

**Solution**:
1. Verify system date/time is correct
2. Check due_date field is set correctly
3. Ensure status field is not manually set to 'Overdue'
