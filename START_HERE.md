# START HERE - Production Security Fix

## The Problem You're Experiencing

You're getting this error when running migrations on production:
```
ERROR: 42P01: relation "checklists" does not exist
```

**Why?** Your production database has different tables than development.

## The Solution - One File

Run **ONLY** this migration file:

```
supabase/migrations/20251016130000_secure_production_final.sql
```

## How to Run It

### Quick Steps

1. Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy/paste the migration file contents
3. Click Run
4. Look for "✓✓✓ SUCCESS ✓✓✓" message
5. Test your app (Rule Management should work)

### Detailed Instructions

See: `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

## What This Fixes

✅ **Security:** Removes all public access, requires authentication
✅ **404 Errors:** Rule Management and Assignment History work
✅ **Database:** Secures all tables that actually exist in production
✅ **No Errors:** Automatically detects tables, won't fail on missing ones

## Expected Output

```
NOTICE: Tables secured: 35
NOTICE: Old policies removed: 57
NOTICE: Public policies remaining: 0
NOTICE: ✓✓✓ SUCCESS ✓✓✓
NOTICE: Database is now SECURE!
```

## Files You Need

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `supabase/migrations/20251016130000_secure_production_final.sql` | **Run this migration** |
| `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` | Detailed step-by-step guide |

## Files to Ignore

❌ Don't use these (they have issues):
- `20251016111026_fix_all_authenticated_only_policies.sql` - Creates insecure access
- `20251016111725_drop_all_public_policies_exact.sql` - Has hardcoded tables
- `20251016111602_secure_all_tables_authenticated_only.sql` - Causes conflicts
- `20251016120000_secure_production_database_safe.sql` - Older version

## After Running Migration

1. Log into your app
2. Go to Rule Management
3. Create/save a rule
4. ✅ Should work without 404 errors

## Need Help?

1. Read `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for troubleshooting
2. Run `verify_production_security.sql` to check status
3. Look for the "✓✓✓ SUCCESS ✓✓✓" message in migration output
