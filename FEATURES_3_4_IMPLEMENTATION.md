1. Location board shows staff status
2. Manager clicks "Break" on location card
3. System creates break schedule entry
4. Location status updates to on_break
5. Break scheduler shows in_progress break

**Break Scheduler → Location Board:**
1. Break scheduled via auto-scheduler
2. Manager starts break in scheduler
3. Deployment.is_on_break set to true
4. Location board status updates automatically
5. Visual indicators sync across both pages

### Data Synchronization

**Real-Time Status Updates:**
```
break_schedules.status = 'in_progress'
  ↓ (trigger)
deployments.is_on_break = true
  ↓
staff_current_locations.status = 'on_break'
  ↓
Location Board UI updates
```

### Database Relationships
```
staff
  ├── staff_current_locations (1:1 current)
  ├── staff_location_history (1:many history)
  └── break_schedules (1:many breaks)

deployments
  ├── staff_current_locations (1:1)
  ├── break_schedules (1:many)

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Location board empty after sync
**Solution:** Verify deployments exist for selected date/shift. Check deployment.date matches selected date.

### Issue: Auto-schedule generates no breaks
**Solution:** Check deployment start/end times. Verify work hours meet minimum requirements (4.5+ hours).

### Issue: Break status not syncing to location board
**Solution:** Check trigger is enabled. Verify deployment_id links are correct.

### Issue: Coverage gaps not showing
**Solution:** Ensure location board synced first. Check position names match between deployments and locations.
