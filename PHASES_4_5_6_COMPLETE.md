## Technical Highlights

### 1. Extensible Architecture
- JSON-based rule definitions allow infinite flexibility
- No code changes needed for new conditions or actions
- Easy addition of new rule types
- Extensible configuration parameters

### 2. Condition Evaluation Engine
Supports complex logical expressions:
```javascript
// Simple condition
{"dt_type": "DT1"}

// Comparison operators
{"num_cooks": {"gte": 2}}
{"forecast": {"lt": 5000}}

// Logical operators
{"and": [
  {"dt_type": "DT1"},
  {"shift_type": "Night Shift"}
]}

{"or": [
  {"day_of_week": "Saturday"},
  {"day_of_week": "Sunday"}
]}

// Negation
{"not": {"dt_type": "DT2"}}

// Array operations
{"day_of_week": {"in": ["Saturday", "Sunday"]}}
```

### 3. Rule Priority System
- Rules execute in priority order (1-1000)
- Lower numbers = higher priority
- Core positions have implicit high priority
- Configuration rules override defaults
- Conditional rules modify final requirements

### 4. Context-Aware Assignment
Context includes:
- Date and day of week
- Shift type (Day/Night)
- Drive-through configuration
- Number of cooks and pack stations
- Staff requirements (shift runner, manager)
- Forecast data
- Custom settings from JSON

### 5. Audit Trail
- Every configuration change logged
- Old and new values captured
- User attribution automatic
- Timestamp precision
- Queryable history

## Example Use Cases

### Use Case 1: DT1 Requires DT Presenter
**Scenario**: When DT1 is selected, a DT Presenter position must always be filled.

**Implementation**:
1. User selects DT1 in configuration modal
2. System checks for conditional rules
3. Rule engine evaluates: `{"dt_type": "DT1"}`
4. Action applied: `{"require_position": "DT Presenter", "count": 1}`
5. Assignment ensures DT Presenter is filled

**Configuration**:
- Rule Name: "DT1 Requires DT Presenter"
- Condition: `{"dt_type": "DT1"}`
- Action: `{"require_position": "DT Presenter", "count": 1}`
- Priority: 10

### Use Case 2: Variable Cook Count
**Scenario**: Restaurant needs 1 or 2 cooks depending on expected business.

**Implementation**:
1. User sets num_cooks to 2 in configuration modal
2. System creates Cook and Cook2 position requirements
3. Assignment fills both cook positions
4. Only trained cooks are assigned

**Result**:
- Flexible staffing based on demand
- No code changes needed
- Saved as default for similar days

### Use Case 3: Weekend Manager Requirement
**Scenario**: Weekends always need a manager on duty.

**Implementation**:
1. Create conditional rule in Rule Management
2. Condition: `{"day_of_week": {"in": ["Saturday", "Sunday"]}}`
3. Action: `{"require_position": "Manager", "count": 1}`
4. Rule automatically applies on weekends

**Configuration**:
- Rule Name: "Weekend Manager Requirement"
- Condition: `{"day_of_week": {"in": ["Saturday", "Sunday"]}}`
- Action: `{"require_position": "Manager", "count": 1}`
- Priority: 5

### Use Case 4: Core Position - Shift Runner
**Scenario**: Every shift must have a shift runner.

**Implementation**:
1. Add Shift Runner to Core Positions
2. Set as mandatory with min_count = 1
3. Apply to "Both" shifts
4. Priority set to 3

**Result**:
- Shift runner always assigned first (high priority)
- Blocks assignment completion if unavailable
- Works across all configurations

---

## Workflow Example

### Complete Auto-Assignment Flow:

1. **Manager Action**:
   - Clicks "Auto-Assign Positions" for Day Shift
   - Configuration modal appears

2. **Configuration Selection**:
   - Selects DT1 (requires DT Presenter)
   - Sets 2 cooks needed
   - Sets 2 pack stations
   - Enables shift runner requirement
   - Enables manager requirement
   - Clicks "Save as Default"
   - Clicks "Confirm & Start"

3. **System Processing**:
   - Loads shift info (forecast: £8,500)
   - Builds context:
     ```javascript
     {
       date: "2025-10-14",
       day_of_week: "Monday",
       shift_type: "Day Shift",
       dt_type: "DT1",
       num_cooks: 2,
       num_pack_stations: 2,
       require_shift_runner: true,
       require_manager: true,
       forecast: 8500
     }
     ```
   - Evaluates conditional rules
   - Applies matching rules
   - Calculates required positions:
     - Manager (config)
     - Shift Runner (config)
     - Cook (config)
     - Cook2 (config)
     - DT Presenter (DT1 rule)
     - Pack positions (from pack station count)

4. **Assignment Execution**:
   - Iterates through each deployment
   - For each staff member:
     - Checks default positions first
     - Falls back to training-based positions
     - Verifies position availability
     - Checks for exclusions
     - Assigns best match
   - Updates database

5. **Results Display**:
   - Shows applied rules: ["DT1 Requires DT Presenter"]
   - Lists assigned staff with positions
   - Shows skipped staff with reasons
   - Displays any failures with errors
   - Includes configuration summary

6. **Data Refresh**:
   - Deployment page refreshes
   - Updated positions visible immediately
   - Changes saved to database
   - Audit trail recorded
