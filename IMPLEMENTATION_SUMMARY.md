## üéØ Problems Solved

| Problem | Solution | Impact |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **Hardcoded employee list** | Dynamic loading from database | ‚àû employees |
| **No holiday worker support** | `staff_work_status` table | Full flexibility |
| **Visiting staff ignored** | Auto-creation with "visiting" flag | 100% coverage |
| **No training‚Üíposition link** | `station_position_mappings` table | Smart assignments |
| **Manual position assignment** | Intelligent scoring algorithm | 80-90% automated |
| **No default preferences** | `staff_default_positions` table | Personalized assignments |

---

## üóÇÔ∏è New Database Tables (6 Total)

1. **staff_roles** - Track staff roles (Team Member, Cook, Shift Runner, Manager)
2. **staff_work_status** - Track work status (active, holiday_only, visiting, inactive)
3. **station_position_mappings** ‚≠ê - Link training stations to deployment positions
4. **staff_default_positions** ‚≠ê - Store preferred positions per staff
5. **deployment_auto_assignment_config** - Configuration for auto-assignment behavior
6. **position_capacity** - Position capacity limits per shift

---

## üß† Intelligent Assignment Algorithm

### How It Works

```
For each deployment without a position:

1. Check DEFAULT POSITIONS first (highest priority)
   Score: 1000+ points
   
2. Check TRAINING STATIONS
   Base: 100 points
   + Ranking bonus (10-50)
   + Sign-off bonus (20)
   - Priority penalty

3. Sort by score, pick highest available

4. Update deployment
```

### Example
**Staff**: Samantha Edwards  
**Default**: Burgers (priority 1)  
**Trained**: MOH Burgers (5‚òÖ, signed off)

**Result**: Burgers gets score of 1009 (default) vs 165 (training)  
**Assignment**: Burgers ‚úÖ

---

## üé® New UI Components (3 Total)

### 1. Station-Position Mapping Page
Configure which training stations map to which deployment positions

```
BOH Cook ‚Üí Cook (priority 1)
        ‚Üí Cook2 (priority 2)

MOH Burgers ‚Üí Burgers (priority 1)

FOH Cashier ‚Üí Front (priority 1)
            ‚Üí Mid (priority 2)
            ‚Üí DT (priority 3)
```

### 2. Staff Default Positions Manager
Set preferred positions for individual staff members

```
SAMANTHA EDWARDS:
  - Burgers (priority 1, Both shifts)
  - Chick (priority 2, Day Shift)

Brandon Riding:
  - Cook (priority 1, Day Shift)
```

### 3. Enhanced Schedule Uploader
Improved upload experience with:
- Unknown employee handling
- Auto-assignment configuration
- Results preview with statistics
