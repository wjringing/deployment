## Integration with Main App

### Update DeploymentManagementSystem.jsx
The main system component needs updates to:
1. Add LocationSelector at top of page
2. Add navigation to Super Admin area
3. Add route guards for super admin features
4. Show/hide admin menu based on role
5. Integrate location context throughout

**Navigation Structure:**
```jsx
// For Super Admins:
- Dashboard (Overview)
- Locations (Manage all locations)
- Users (Manage all users)
- Regions & Areas (Hierarchical management)
- Audit Logs (System activity)
- Settings (System-wide config)

// For Location Admins:
- [Location Selector] (if multiple locations)
- Deployments
- Staff
- Training
- Reports
- Settings (location-specific)

// For Location Operators:
- [Location Selector] (if multiple locations)
- Deployments (limited edit)
- Staff (view only)
- Reports (view only)
```

## Required Code Updates

### 1. Update App.jsx Routing
Add routes for new admin pages:
```jsx
<Route path="/admin/dashboard" element={<SuperAdminDashboard />} />
<Route path="/admin/users" element={<UserManagement />} />
<Route path="/admin/locations" element={<LocationManagement />} />
<Route path="/admin/regions" element={<RegionalManagement />} />
<Route path="/admin/audit" element={<AuditLogViewer />} />
<Route path="/admin/onboarding" element={<LocationOnboardingWizard />} />
```

### 2. Update DeploymentManagementSystem.jsx
```jsx
import LocationSelector from './LocationSelector';
import SuperAdminDashboard from './SuperAdminDashboard';
import { useAuth } from '../contexts/AuthContext';
import { useLocation } from '../contexts/LocationContext';

// Add at top of component:
const { isSuperAdmin, isLocationAdmin } = useAuth();
const { currentLocation } = useLocation();

// Add admin navigation when super admin
{isSuperAdmin() && (
  <AdminNavigation />
)}

// Add location selector for non-super admins with multiple locations
{!isSuperAdmin() && hasMultipleLocations && (
  <LocationSelector />
)}
```

### 3. Update useLocationData Hook
Already done! The hook automatically filters by location_id.

### 4. Update All Data Loading
Already done! RLS policies enforce location filtering at database level.

## Testing Checklist

### Phase 1 Tests (Completed)
- [x] Database schema created
- [x] RLS policies applied
- [x] Data migration successful
- [x] Authentication working
- [x] Build succeeds

### Phase 2 Tests (In Progress)
- [x] Super Admin Dashboard displays
- [x] User Management CRUD works
- [ ] Location Management CRUD works
- [ ] Onboarding wizard completes successfully
- [ ] Regional management functional
- [ ] Audit logs display correctly

### Phase 3 Tests (Pending)
- [ ] Create 2 test locations
- [ ] Create users with different roles
- [ ] Verify data isolation between locations
- [ ] Test location switching
- [ ] Verify RLS policies block unauthorized access
- [ ] Test all export functions with location data
- [ ] Performance test with multiple locations

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Apply Database Migrations
Already done via MCP Supabase tool:
- `create_multi_location_foundation.sql`
- `implement_location_scoped_rls_policies.sql`

### Step 2: Create Super Admin User
```sql
-- Sign up via UI first, then:
UPDATE user_profiles
SET role = 'super_admin', status = 'active'
WHERE email = 'your-admin@email.com';
```

### Step 3: Create Test Locations
```sql
-- Via UI or SQL:
INSERT INTO locations (location_code, location_name, city, region, status)
VALUES
  ('3017', 'KFC Manchester', 'Manchester', 'North West', 'active'),
  ('3018', 'KFC Birmingham', 'Birmingham', 'West Midlands', 'active');
```

### Step 4: Test User Creation
1. Login as super admin
2. Navigate to User Management
3. Create test location admin
4. Assign to test location
5. Logout and login as new user
6. Verify only sees assigned location data

### Step 5: Deploy to Production
```bash
# Build production bundle
npm run build

# Deploy dist/ folder to web server
# Ensure environment variables are set
# Verify SSL certificate
# Test authentication flow
```
