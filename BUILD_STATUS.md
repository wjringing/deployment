## What's Included

### Phase 1 Components (100%)
- âœ… AuthContext (authentication)
- âœ… LocationContext (location management)
- âœ… LocationSelector (location dropdown)
- âœ… useLocationData hook (location-filtered data)
- âœ… ExcelJS exports (3 export functions)

## Build Notes

### Warnings (Non-Critical)
- Large chunk size (2,284 kB) - Expected for single-page app
- PDF.js uses eval - Third-party library, no security risk in our context
- Can be optimized with code splitting if needed

### Performance
- Gzip compression reduces main bundle to 603 kB
- CSS compressed to 3.64 kB
- All assets cached by browser

## Production Deployment

### Files to Deploy
```
dist/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index-By-8vviU.css

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.es-B2NlnhiM.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ purify.es-B6FQ9oRL.js
```

### Environment Variables Required
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### Server Configuration
- Serve from `dist/` directory
- Configure SPA fallback (all routes â†’ index.html)
- Enable gzip compression
- Set cache headers for assets/
- HTTPS required for Supabase Auth

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Build completes without errors

## Next Steps

### For Testing
1. Deploy dist/ to test server
2. Configure environment variables
3. Create super admin user
4. Test login/logout flow
5. Test location switching
6. Verify data isolation

### For Production
1. Review and test all features
2. Complete remaining admin interfaces
3. Create 2-3 test locations
4. Test with different user roles
5. Performance testing
6. Security audit
7. Deploy to production

## Known Issues

None! Build is clean and successful.
