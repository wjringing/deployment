2. **Secondary Position Assignment** (New)
   - After primary deployments created
   - Process each unique date in schedule
   - Call `autoAssignSecondaryPositions` for Day and Night shifts
   - Results tracked separately per shift type

3. **Closing Station Assignment** (New)
   - Runs only for Night Shift deployments
   - Calls `assignClosingStations` for each night shift date
   - Validates training and marks closing duties
   - Results tracked in closingAssignments array

#### Enhanced Results Object:

```javascript
{
  success: [...],              // Primary deployment successes
  failed: [...],               // Primary deployment failures
  skipped: [...],              // Primary deployment skips
  secondaryAssignments: [      // Secondary position results per date/shift
    {
      date,
      shiftType,
      assigned: [...],
      skipped: [...],
      failed: [...]
    }
  ],
  closingAssignments: [        // Closing duty results per date
    {
      date,
      assigned: [...],
      skipped: [...],
      failed: [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

## How It Works

### Secondary Position Auto-Assignment Flow:

1. **Schedule Upload**
   - User uploads TeamLive PDF schedule
   - System parses shifts and creates deployments
   - Primary positions remain empty initially

2. **Primary Position Assignment**
   - Intelligent auto-deployment assigns primary positions
   - Based on training, rankings, and configuration

3. **Secondary Position Auto-Assignment** (Automatic)
   - System identifies all deployments with primary positions
   - Looks up configured secondary mappings
   - Checks staff qualification for each secondary candidate
   - Validates position availability and capacity
   - Assigns highest priority available secondary
   - Updates deployment with has_secondary flag

4. **Result**
   - Deployment has both primary and secondary positions
   - Full shift coverage achieved automatically
   - Visual confirmation in deployment card

### Closing Station Validation Flow:

1. **Night Shift Detection**
   - System identifies deployments classified as Night Shift
   - Checks which positions require closing training

2. **Training Validation**
   - For each night shift deployment
   - System validates staff has closing training for their position
   - Checks training hasn't expired
   - Verifies manager sign-off if required

3. **Priority-Based Assignment**
   - When multiple trained staff available
   - Priority order: **Seniority (60%) + Rankings (40%)**
   - Seniority calculated from staff.created_at date
   - Rankings averaged from staff_rankings table

4. **Closing Duty Marking**
   - Validated deployments marked with is_closing_duty = true
   - Closing_validated flag indicates training confirmed
   - Results tracked for reporting

5. **Visual Feedback**
   - Deployment cards show closing badges
   - Color indicates validation status
   - Coverage reports show gaps

## Configuration Guide

### Setting Up Secondary Positions:

1. Navigate to **Settings → Position Relationships → Secondary Positions**

2. Select a **Primary Position** (e.g., DT)

3. Select a **Secondary Position** (e.g., DT Pack)

4. Set **Priority** (1 = highest, lower numbers tried first)

5. Choose **Shift Type** (Both, Day Shift, or Night Shift)

6. Check **Auto-deploy** if you want automatic assignment

7. Click **Add** to save the mapping

**Tips:**
- Lower priority numbers = higher priority
- Can have multiple secondaries per primary
- Disable mappings temporarily without deleting
- Different mappings for day vs. night shifts

### Configuring Closing Requirements:

1. Navigate to **Settings → Position Relationships → Closing Requirements**

2. Select a **Position** that needs closing duties

3. Choose **Shift Type** (typically Night Shift)

4. Set **Minimum Trained Staff** required

5. Set **Closing Start Time** (when duties begin, e.g., 22:00)

6. Click **Add** to create requirement

**Tips:**
- Only positions with requirements will be validated
- Set realistic minimum staff counts
- Adjust closing start time based on store hours
- Can temporarily deactivate without deletion

### Adding Closing Training:

Currently requires manual database entry. Use Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
INSERT INTO staff_closing_training (staff_id, position_id, is_trained, trained_date)
SELECT
  (SELECT id FROM staff WHERE name = 'Staff Name'),
  (SELECT id FROM positions WHERE name = 'Position Name' AND type = 'position'),
  true,
  now();
```

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO staff_closing_training (staff_id, position_id, is_trained)
   SELECT s.id, p.id, true
   FROM staff s, positions p
   WHERE s.name = 'Staff Name' AND p.name = 'Front';
   ```
3. Assign that staff to Front on night shift
4. Run closing station assignment
5. Verify deployment marked with closing duty
6. Check validation status

### Test Priority Order:

1. Create multiple staff with closing training for same position
2. Ensure different created_at dates (seniority)

   - Adjust priorities as needed
   - Add any custom mappings

3. **Phase 3: Add Closing Training**
   - Identify experienced staff
   - Add closing training records
   - Test with small number first

4. **Phase 4: Enable Auto-Assignment**
   - Start with one shift type
   - Monitor results
   - Adjust configuration based on feedback

5. **Phase 5: Full Deployment**
   - Enable for all shifts
   - Train managers on system
   - Document any custom rules

## Troubleshooting

### Secondary Position Not Assigned:

**Check:**
- Is mapping configured and enabled?
- Does staff have training for secondary position?
- Is secondary position already at capacity?
- Is auto_deploy flag set to true?

**Solution:**
- Review position_secondary_mappings table
- Check staff_training_stations for qualifications
- Verify position_capacity limits
- Enable auto-deploy if needed

### Closing Validation Failing:

**Check:**
- Does position have closing requirement configured?
- Does staff have closing training record?
- Has training expired?
- Is requirement active?

**Solution:**
- Add requirement in closing_station_requirements
- Insert training record in staff_closing_training
- Check expiry_date field
- Activate requirement if disabled

### Wrong Staff Selected for Closing:

**Check:**
- Staff seniority (created_at dates)
- Staff rankings in staff_rankings table
- Priority calculation formula

**Solution:**
- Verify created_at dates are correct
- Add/update rankings for staff
- Formula: (seniority_days * 0.6) + (avg_ranking * 0.4)
