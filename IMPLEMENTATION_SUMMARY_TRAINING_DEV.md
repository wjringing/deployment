## Security Considerations

### Current Security

âœ… Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all new tables
âœ… Public access policies (consistent with existing architecture)
âœ… Audit trail fields (created_by, assigned_by, measured_by)
âœ… Timestamp tracking (created_at, updated_at)
âœ… Foreign key constraints prevent orphaned records
âœ… Check constraints on status fields prevent invalid values

### Recommended Future Enhancements

ðŸ”’ Role-based access control (Manager, Staff, Admin roles)
ðŸ”’ Field-level encryption for sensitive notes
ðŸ”’ Two-factor authentication for training verification
ðŸ”’ Enhanced audit logging of all changes
ðŸ”’ Data retention policies
ðŸ”’ PII protection compliance
