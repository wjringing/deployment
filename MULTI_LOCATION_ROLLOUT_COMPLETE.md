## Technical Implementation

### Database Changes
```sql
New Tables:
- locations (store information)
- user_profiles (extended user data)
- user_location_access (permission mapping)
- regions (organizational hierarchy)
- areas (organizational hierarchy)
- audit_logs (system activity tracking)

Modified Tables:
- All 40+ existing tables now have location_id
- Composite indexes on (location_id, date)
- Foreign key constraints maintained
```

### Security Implementation
```sql
Helper Functions:
- get_user_role() - Returns current user's role
- is_super_admin() - Checks super admin status
- get_user_locations() - Returns accessible locations

RLS Policies:
- Location-scoped access on all tables
- Role-based permission checks
- Audit trail enforcement
- Complete data isolation
```

### Application Architecture
```
Provider Hierarchy:
BrowserRouter
└── AuthProvider (manages authentication)
    └── LocationProvider (manages location context)
        └── App (main application)
            ├── LocationSelector (header component)
            └── Protected Routes (role-based)
```

## Production Deployment Guide

### Build Output

├── assets/
│   ├── index-By-8vviU.css (15.65 KB)
│   ├── index-CO62nzLF.js (2,284.65 KB)

```

### Environment Configuration
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### Server Requirements
- Serve from dist/ directory
- SPA fallback routing (all routes → index.html)
- Gzip compression enabled
- Cache headers for assets/
- HTTPS required for Supabase Auth

### Initial Setup Steps
1. Deploy dist/ to web server
2. Configure environment variables
3. Create first super admin user via Supabase dashboard
4. Manually set role to 'super_admin' in user_profiles table
5. Login and access admin interfaces

## Testing Plan

### Phase 1: Single Location Testing
- [ ] Login with super admin account
- [ ] Verify Oswestry data is accessible
- [ ] Test all existing features work
- [ ] Verify exports include location context
- [ ] Check audit logs are recording

### Phase 2: Multi-Location Testing
- [ ] Create 2-3 test locations via SQL
- [ ] Create location admin users
- [ ] Assign users to specific locations
- [ ] Login as different users
- [ ] Verify data isolation is working
- [ ] Test location switching
- [ ] Verify unauthorized access is blocked

### Phase 3: Role Testing
- [ ] Test super_admin can see all locations
- [ ] Test location_admin sees only their store
- [ ] Test location_operator has read-only access
- [ ] Test regional_manager sees region locations
- [ ] Test area_manager sees area locations

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Current Limitations
- Admin interfaces only 60% complete
- No location onboarding wizard yet
- No regional reporting interface yet
- No audit log viewer interface yet
- Manual super admin promotion required initially

### Non-Issues
- Large bundle size (2.28 MB) is expected for feature-rich SPA
- PDF.js eval usage is from third-party library
- Can be optimized with code splitting if needed

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Complete Admin Interfaces (Recommended)
1. LocationManagement.jsx (4-6 hours)
2. LocationOnboardingWizard.jsx (6-8 hours)
3. RegionalManagement.jsx (4-6 hours)
4. AuditLogViewer.jsx (3-4 hours)

### Option 2: Test with Multiple Locations
1. Create 2-3 test locations
2. Create test users with different roles
3. Verify data isolation
4. Test all workflows
5. Gather feedback

### Option 3: Gradual Production Rollout
1. Deploy to production with Oswestry only
2. Monitor for 1-2 weeks
3. Add 2-3 pilot stores
4. Test and refine
5. Roll out to remaining stores
6. Complete admin interfaces as needed
