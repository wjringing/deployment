## Frequently Asked Questions

### Fixed Closing Positions

**Q: What happens if I assign someone to a fixed closing position but they're not trained?**
A: Fixed positions override auto-assignment but still require the staff member to be trained for that position. Ensure they have proper training first.

**Q: Can I assign someone to multiple closing positions?**
A: Yes! Use the priority field to determine which position takes precedence. Priority 1 is assigned first, then 2, then 3, etc.

**Q: How do I temporarily disable a fixed assignment?**
A: Click the "Active" button on the assignment to toggle it to "Inactive". The staff member will then be assigned normally by the system.

### Training Plans

**Q: How do I add items to a training plan after creating it?**
A: Currently, items are added through the training management system. Future updates will add an item management interface directly in the plan view.

**Q: Can I delete a training plan?**
A: Training plans can be cancelled by changing their status to "Cancelled". This preserves historical records while indicating the plan is no longer active.

**Q: What's the difference between "Completed" and "On Hold"?**
A: "Completed" means the plan finished successfully. "On Hold" means training is temporarily paused but will resume later.

### Cross-Training Opportunities

**Q: Do opportunities automatically create training plans?**
A: No, opportunities are suggestions. After approving an opportunity, you must manually create a training plan and add it to the plan.

**Q: Who should identify cross-training opportunities?**
A: Managers, shift leaders, and the staff member themselves can all identify opportunities. The "identified_by" field tracks who suggested it.

**Q: Can I decline an opportunity?**
A: Yes, set the status to "Declined" with a note explaining why it's not appropriate at this time.

### Mandatory Training

**Q: What happens when recurring training is due again?**
A: The system automatically updates the status to "Assigned" on the next due date. You don't need to create a new assignment.

**Q: Can I extend a due date?**
A: Currently, you need to update the due_date field manually. Consider adding a note explaining the extension reason.

**Q: How do I handle training that applies to everyone?**
A: You'll need to create individual assignments for each staff member. Future updates may add bulk assignment features.

### General

**Q: Can I export training data?**
A: Reporting features are built into database views. Ask your IT team about connecting to the database for custom reports.

**Q: Who can see training information?**
A: Currently, all authenticated users can view training data. Consider implementing role-based access control for sensitive information.

**Q: How is training data backed up?**
A: Training data is stored in the main database and included in regular database backups. Consult your IT team for backup schedules.
